## Hi there, I'm Mansi!

A junior at the University of Texas at Austin, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration. My passions lie in UI/UX, full-stack development, and any space where creativity meets technical problem-solving. I love exploring the intersection of technology, business, and design to build real-world solutions that make a meaningful impact on communities.
